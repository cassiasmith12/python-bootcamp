TODO

1. find a room: bld 3? (friday taken, sci colloquium), 8?
need to schedule room within next few weeks.
The idea is to reserve a big room for ~100 people,
reserve some spots for the interns, then open the registration.
multiple rooms? would need more people...

--> Jeremy: find the room, find the old list of participants and 
excluded from last year (get priority this year). 

--> Nino (antonino.cucchiara@nasa.gov) will collect ideas/proposals 
for intern prep. before they can take the bootcamp.
pre-workshop?unix base training?pre-screening?

2. website
--> Dave Davis will take over.

3. Agenda
--> EVERYBODY get github: people need to look up agenda and 
topics. It has been recently merged with Berkeley bootcamp

4. Announcements
--> Joey Gurganus will send the Announcements to the different codes
--> Jeremy send Joey the relevant mailing lists
